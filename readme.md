## Description

As web developers, there might come a time when we approach development for E-Commerce, one of the largest sectors in the electronics industry. This E-Commerce Back End application demonstrates how users are able to create, search, update, and delete product, category, and product-tag data using various technologies such as:

`Node.js | Sequelize.js | Express.js | JavaScript | MySQL | dotenv`

## Installation

First we install our dependencies by running `npm i`

Create a database in MySQL to contain our product data

Once we have a database running, we can now proceed to seed our data using `npm run seed`!

## Usage

When all our product data is done seeding, you're done! You may now run `npm start` to access the live server through sequelize.

Open up the app in insomnia and now you're able to create, read, update, and delete product, tags, and category data!
